########## Problems ##########

# Write a function that removes duplicates from a list and returns a list with unique elements only. Use sets to achieve this.


def remove_duplicates(lst: list) -> list:
  pass


# Write a function that finds the common elements between two lists.


def common_elements(lst1: list, lst2: list) -> list:
  pass


# Write a function that finds the elements that are in one list but not in another.

def elements_in_first_not_second(lst1: list, lst2: list) -> list:
  pass


# Given a list of numbers from 1 to n with some numbers missing, write a function that finds the missing numbers using sets.


def find_missing_numbers(lst: list, n: int) -> list:
  pass


# Write a function that returns a set of unique words from a given sentence.


def unique_words(sentence: str) -> list[str]:
  pass


# Write a function that takes in a list of integers and a number 'n'. Return True if any two numbers in the list add up to n and False otherwise.


def contains_sum(lst: list, n: int) -> bool:
  pass
